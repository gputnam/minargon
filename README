Minargon - Detector Monitoring for SBN
============================================

Minargon is a website used for online monitoring in the SBN
collaboration (in the SBND and ICARUS detectors)

Quickstart
----------


To run a local copy of minargon, first create a virtual environment and activate
it.

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Make sure you have a recent version of pip:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip

Note: to install minargon, you need recent versions of pip, virtualenv,
and python. Some FNAL servers don't have all these working. If you
could not follow the preceeding step, instead try the following:

On the fermilab gpvm servers, setup python v2_7_14 through
ups. Then, run the `virtualenv` commands below with `python
~gputnam/virtualenv-15.1.0/virtualenv.py` (this is an instance of
virtualenv that I have setup myself for use).

Now, clone the minargon repository, and install the prerequisites:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SBNSoftware/sbndaq-minargon.git
    $ cd minargon
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Minargon needs a configuration file to run with the settings of where
the Redis Database is located. An example settings file is given in
`example_settigns.conf`. Either use those settings, or make a new
settings file (if your database in a different location). Then set:

    $ export MINARGON_SETTINGS=`pwd`/your_settings_file.conf

Note on the different example settings files:
	-`example_settings.conf` sets up a website instance with no database connections
	-`example_settings_with_local_redis.conf` sets up a website instance with a 
		database connection to an (already running) instance of redis
	-`example_settings_icarus_gateway.conf` sets up a website instance with the 
		proper database connections as running on the icarus-gateway machine

Now, you can start up the webserver:

    $ ./runserver.py

And you should be able to open your web browser to localhost:5000 and see it.

Note that if you are running on a remote server, you will have to
forward port 5000 back to your laptop in order to view the website. To
do this, when ssh-ing into the remote server, add in the parameter: `-L
5000:localhost:5000`.
